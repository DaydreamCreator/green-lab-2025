## Set up environment and dependencies
***Set up virtual environment***

Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv /path/`
This can be anywhere on your machine. Activate it with `source /path/bin/activate`

***Install dependencies (MacOS)***

- Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed
- Install OpenJDK 8, Android SDK and Platform Tools:
  ```
  brew install --cask temurin@8 android-sdk android-platform-tools
  ```
  
*If you meet the notice of outdated formulae, can `brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup` to upgrade all installed packages, and clean outdated ones.*


- Install libxml2: `brew install libxml2`
- Check Java version: java -version, if you are running a different version than 1.8/8, `brew install jenv`
- Run `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` to see the location of your Java environments
- Copy the location of your AdoptOpenJDK8 environment:
  ```
  Run jenv add <AdoptOpenJDK8_path>
  Run jenv global 1.8
  ```
- Restart terminal and verify your Java version with java -version, it should output openjdk version "1.8.0_265"
- Install the requirements, under the android-runner: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Install the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
**NOT support Windows machines with ARM-based CPUs**

1. After installation, create a new project, preferly with less cumulative distribution (minimum SDK settings).
2. Run the created device, it would take a while to finish.
3. Check the running emulator IDï¼š`adb devices`, it typically displays:
```
List of devices attached 
emulator-5554 device
```
4. Change the `devices` settings in `config.json` file using the displayed device identifier (with mapping to key-value pairs in `devices.json`).
