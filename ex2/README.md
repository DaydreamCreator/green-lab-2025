# EX 2- Getting to know [EnergiBridge](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge)

## Exercise 
For now we're going to stick with a simple experiment with one single factor and one single level. Later on 
we will see how to run more interesting experiments. The focus of this exercise is to teach you understand how `EnergiBridge` act as a profiler within the `experiment-runner` framework. For this, we just want a single run of 
the following command:
```
energibridge --summary -o test.csv sleep 5
```

We will measure the total CPU enery and the total memory used of 5 seconds. Example Output in terminal:
```
Energy consumption in joules: 253.86045820617682 for 5.1230927 sec of execution.
```
Open the generated `test.csv` file to check details of raw EnergiBridge file. Output Format of `test.csv`:
```

Energy consumption calculated by EnergiBridge is **system dependent**, and output can change accordingly. Some details can refer to [this](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge/blob/main/chart.ipynb).
